# idlegovern
simple text based governing game in js. Currently very very barebones with no win and lose condition.
Accessible from [https://muncuss.github.io/idlegovern/index.html](https://muncuss.github.io/idlegovern/index.html)

Become the lord of a town, governing few thousands civilian. Civilian is divided to farmer (produce food), artisan (produce goods), gatherer (produce material), and merchant (being a merchant, buy and sell things).

Civilian require food and goods to be eaten or to produce things (goods equal to clothes, tools, furniture, etc), and both will break and rot overtime. so they will buy it from the merchant.

Merchant will buy things from other civilian every 1st day of month. and you can monitor the console to know what happened behind.

Monster will attack town, and as they grow overtime, the size of attack will also become bigger. so you need to raise troop to defend the town. or you can assign them in a mission to destroy the monster's lair.
